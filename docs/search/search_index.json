The query syntax draws inspiration from GraphQL and is similar, but with many differences. Some capabilities missing from GraphQL have been added, and some capabilities found in GraphQL have a different syntax. We believe that much of conventional SQL syntax is still preferable to creating a completely new syntax for every single feature of the query language (i.e., conventional syntax wherever possible). However, whereas SQL can be seen as a “low level” relational query language, OQL takes a higher level Entity-Relationship (ER) Model view of the database.\nThe name “OQL” refers to both a software library, and a query language implemented within that library. The OQL library provides support for data retrieval (via the OQL query language) as well as a query builder for constructing queries in programmatically. There are also class methods for performing all kinds of mutations, including mutations that support the ER view of the database. Furthermore, query and mutation operations all abide by the supplied ER data model.\nSome features of OQL include:\nthe query language is similar to GraphQL in that query results have exactly the structure requested in the query (i.e., you get what you ask for) uses a very simple Entity-Relationship Model description of the database works with the PostgreSQL database system designed to work with existing databases without having to change the database at all","title":"Overview"},{"location":"/introduction.html#relationships","text":"OQL recognizes all the various kinds of entity relationships, and provides a way to explicitly define them:\nOne-to-Many The one-to-many relationship means that an object of some entity A can relate to any number of objects of some entity B. It is possible for A and B to be the same entity: entities can be in a self relationship. Furthermore, that self relationship can be indirect with intermediate entities. The one-to-many relationship is just the flip version of many-to-one: if A is one-to-many in how it relates to B, then B is many-to-one in how it relates to A. Many-to-one The many-to-one relationship means that any number of objects of some entity A can relate to a single object of some entity B. Many-to-many The many-to-many relationship means that any number of objects of some entity A can relate to any number of objects of some entity B. In OQL, this is accomplished by both defining that the relationship exists and defining a junction or link entity to facilitate the links between A and B. One-to-one The one-to-one relationship that an object of some entity A can relate to a single object of some entity B and no more.","title":"Relationships"},{"location":"/installation.html","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"/installation.html#installation","text":"","title":"Installation"},{"location":"/installation.html#typescript-javascript","text":"There is a Node.js module available through the npm registry.\nInstall using the npm install command:\nnpm install @vinctus/oql\nTypeScript declarations are included in the package.","title":"TypeScript/JavaScript"},{"location":"/installation.html#scala-js","text":"There is a Scala.js library available through Github Packages.\nAdd the following lines to your build.sbt:\nexternalResolvers += \"OQL\" at \"https://maven.pkg.github.com/vinctustech/oql\"\n\nlibraryDependencies += \"com.vinctus\" %%% \"-vinctus-oql\" % \"1.1.9\"\n\nCompile / npmDependencies ++= Seq(\n  \"pg\" -> \"8.10.0\",\n  \"@types/pg\" -> \"8.6.6\",\n  \"source-map-support\": \"0.5.21\"\n)","title":"Scala.js"},{"location":"/tutorial.html","text":"","title":"Tutorial"},{"location":"/tutorial.html#tutorial","text":"We present a fully explained tutorial example showing how to apply OQL to an SQL database.

It’s not necessary to describe every field of every table in the database, only what is being retrieved with OQL. However, primary keys of tables that are being queried should always be included, even if you’re not interested in retrieving the primary keys themselves.\nWe’d like to look at the data model in some detail to explain what’s going on. If you’d rather skip ahead and get on with the tutorial, then go to Many-to-one Query.\nThe above data model describes to OQL the database that we just created. There’s an entity definition corresponding to each table in the database. Each entity has an attribute definition corresponding to each column in the corresponding table, and in OQL it’s possible to have attributes that don’t correspond to any declared column.\nThe first line of the data model\nentity employee (employees) {\nmeans that the entity employee corresponds to table employees in the actual database. This means that table names in an SQL database can be aliased and frequently are, but it’s optional.\nThe second line\n*emp_id: integer\nmeans that emp_id is the primary key, signified by the *, in the corresponding table, and that it has an 32-bit integer type.\nThe third line\nname (emp_name): text\nsays that the table has a column called emp_name with a variable character string type, but that we want name to be the alias. Attribute aliasing is optional, but is very frequently done.\nLine five\nmanager (manager_id): employee\nsays that the table has a column called manager_id which is a foreign key referencing the table corresponding to entity employee, and we would like manager to be the alias for that attribute. This attribute is said to have an “entity” type, and puts the employee entity in a many-to-one relationship with itself.\nThe sixth line\ndepartment (dep_id): department\nmeans that entity employee is also in a many-to-one relationship with entity department (since dep_id is a foreign key).\nNote Entities can be defined in any order. In the above attribute definition, entity department is being referenced even thought its definition comes after.\nOn line thirteen within the department entity definition we find\nemployees: [employee]\nwhich defines an attribute called employees with the “entity array” type [employee]. This attribute doesn’t correspond to any column in the table, but rather asserts the one-to-many relationship that entity department has to entity employee, and facilitates queries to department that presuppose that the relationship exists.\nNote OQL checks the internal correctness of the entire data model. Specifically, whether entity array type attributes have a corresponding referencing entity type attribute.","title":"Create the Data Model"},{"location":"/tutorial.html#many-to-one-query","text":"Run the following TypeScript program:\nimport { OQL } from '@vinctus/oql'\nimport fs from 'fs'\n\nconst oql = new OQL(\n  fs.readFileSync('data-model').toString(),\n  'localhost',\n  5432,\n  'postgres',\n  'postgres',\n  'docker',\n  false,\n  0,\n  10\n)\n\noql\n  .queryMany(\n    `\n    employee { \n      name manager: manager.name department { name }\n    } [job_title = 'CLERK']`\n  )\n  .then((res: any) => console.log(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2)))\nOutput:\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"JULIUS\",\n    \"manager\": \"BLAZE\",\n    \"department\": {\n      \"name\": \"MARKETING\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"MARKER\",\n    \"manager\": \"CLARE\",\n    \"department\": {\n      \"name\": \"FINANCE\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"ANDRES\",\n    \"manager\": \"SCARLET\",\n    \"department\": {\n      \"name\": \"AUDIT\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"SANDRINE\",\n    \"manager\": \"FRANK\",\n    \"department\": {\n      \"name\": \"AUDIT\"\n    }\n  }\n]\nThe query\nemployee { \n  name manager: manager.name department { name }\n} [job_title = 'CLERK']\nis asking for the names of employees with job title “CLERK” as well as the names of their manager and department.

Currently, only entity and enum (enumeration) declarations are supported. Enum Enums (enumerations) correspond to enum types in the database. An enum comprises an identifier matching the name of the corresponding enum type, and an ordered list of text values (not command separated) known as labels. Label Enum labels look like single quoted strings (so that you can have spaces in them). Entity Entities correspond to tables in the database. An entity comprises an identifier matching the name of the corresponding table, which can be given an alias, and a series of attributes. Identifier An identifier can have letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but may not begin with a digit. Alias Aliases are identifiers. Attribute Attributes correspond to columns in a table, if they have a data type, or a simple entity type (i.e., just the name of an entity). An attribute that begins with an asterisk is the primary key. The name of an attribute can be aliased. An attribute that ends with an exclamation mark can’t be null or excluded when inserting. Type There are several kinds of attribute types: DataType corresponding to a database data type. These attributes correspond to table columns that are not foreign keys. EnumName corresponding to a database enum type. EntityName representing the many-to-one relationship (from the point of view of the current entity). This is the entity relationship type that corresponds to a table column that is a foreign key. [ EntityName ] or [ EntityName ] . AttributeName representing the one-to-many relationship (from the point of view of the current entity). This is the array type that represents all the entities (rows) that are referencing the current entity. [ EntityName ] ( EntityName ) or [ EntityName ] . AttributeName ( EntityName ) representing the many-to-many relationship. The second EntityName in parentheses refers to the junction or link entity (table). < EntityName > or < EntityName > . AttributeName representing the one-to-one relationship (the current entity is the one being referenced by a foreign key). DataType Any one of the basic data types that are commonly support by database systems. Any group of datatypes that begin with the same spelling (beyond the first one or two letters) are synonymous (e.g., bool and boolean refer to the same datatype). EnumName An EnumName is an identifier that corresponds to the identifier given as the enum name. EntityName An EntityName is an identifier that corresponds either to the identifier given as the entity name if it wasn’t aliased, or to the alias if it was. AttributeName An AttributeName is an identifier that corresponds either to the identifier given as the attribute name if it wasn’t aliased, or to the alias if it was.","title":"Data Modeling Grammar Rules"},{"location":"/syntax.html#query-language","text":"The query language is inspired by GraphQL. In the following grammar, all keywords (double-quoted string literals) are case-insensitive.","title":"Query Language"},{"location":"/syntax.html#query-grammar-rules","text":"query A data retrieval query expression begins with the name of the entity being queried followed by zero or more optional relational operations: project This relational operation specifies the structure of the result. If omitted, the result will comprise all datatype attributes (i.e., columns that are not foreign keys) only, in the order in which they were defined in the data model. The fact that relational attributes must be explicitly specified prevents circularity as well as the retrieval of, possibly very large amounts of unneeded data. The structure of the result is basically a sequence of expressions each with an (often implicit) label. attributeProject The syntax of an attribute within a project is essentially a possibly optional label, followed by an expression, or an inner query if it is a reference to an array type attribute. label Results are in the form of objects which can are thought of as a list of property/value pairs. Therefore, in order to build a result, the property names have to be known. A label, when it is given becomes the property name of the associated value. If omitted, there are simple obvious rules for inferring it. entityName An entityName is an identifier that names an entity (table) or it’s alias. attributeName An attributeName is an identifier that names a column (attribute) or it’s alias. applyExpression Function application has conventional syntax (e.g., SUM(cost)). Currently, function names pass through transpilation unchecked. attributeExpression An attributeExpression is an identifier that names an attribute, whether it’s a column or not, or it’s alias. qualifiedAttributeExpression This is a reference to an attribute that essentially traverses or dereferences a foreign key. select The select relational operation contains a boolean row selection or filter expression. If omitted, all rows will be retrieved.The row selection condition must be a boolean valued expression. group The group operation contains a series of one or more grouping expressions by which an array result will be grouped. order The order operation contains a series of one or more ordering expressions by which an array result will be ordered. Database engines differ in how they order results that contain null values. OQL guarantees a consistent default behaviour across supported engines. For ascending ordering, nulls are first. For descending ordering, nulls are last. restrict This is really two operations that tend to go together: offsetting or skipping an initial number of results, and limiting the number of results. The first integer is the offset (zero if omitted), and the second is the limit (unlimited if omitted). booleanExpression A booleanExpression is a boolean (true or false) valued expression that may be a disjunction (logical “or”) of two or more boolean valued expressions. andExpression An andExpression is a boolean valued expression that may be a conjunction (logical “and”) of two or more boolean valued expressions. notExpression A notExpression allows a boolean valued expression to be negated. booleanPrimary These are the most basic kinds of boolean valued expressions. expression multiplicative primary identifier string There are two types of string literals: single quoted and double quoted. Single quoted strings are delimited by single quotes, and so cannot contain a single quote unless it is escaped. Double quoted strings are delimited by double quotes, and so cannot contain a double quote unless it is escaped. Strings can have the following characters and escape sequences: any unicode character except for: characters in the range \\x00-\\x1F, character \\x7F backslashes are not allowed unless followed by one of the characters: \\'\"bfnrtu if a backslash is followed by a u, then 4 hexadecimal digits must follow after that","title":"Query Grammar Rules"},{"location":"/supported-engines.html","text":"","title":"Supported Engines"},{"location":"/supported-engines.html#supported-engines","text":"","title":"Supported Engines"},{"location":"/supported-engines.html#postgresql","text":"","title":"PostgreSQL"},{"location":"/supported-engines.html#postgresql-specific-features","text":"","title":"PostgreSQL Specific Features"},{"location":"/tests.html","text":"","title":"Tests"},{"location":"/tests.html#tests","text":"","title":"Tests"},{"location":"/tests.html#requirements","text":"Git (for cloning) Java 11+ sbt (for building and running tests)","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"/tests.html#setup-postgresql","text":"To run the unit test, you will need to get PostgreSQL running in a docker container:\ndocker pull postgres\ndocker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 postgres\nThe PostgreSQL client (psql) should be installed.
